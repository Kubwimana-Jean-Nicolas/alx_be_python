# Step 1: Define the variables
principal = 1000   # initial investment ($1000)
rate = 0.05        # 5% annual interest rate
time = 3           # time in years

# Step 2: Calculate simple interest using formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Step 3: Print result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
